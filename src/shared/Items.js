Customers have praised the A330-200F for its outstanding flexibility, which is further enhanced by the freighter’s full operational commonality with Airbus’ fly-by-wire family of single-aisle and wide-body jetliners. In addition, its large main deck cargo door allows the aircraft to accept all commonly-used pallets and containers. ",
